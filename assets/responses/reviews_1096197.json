Music is meh. Poor acting (but they clearly got no support). This crap show's the contempt producers like this have for the audience that gives them money. The writer, director, producers and editor must have been so full of ego that I bet continues today, despite the poor reviews. During the boring minutes (90) I drifted off imagining them all working on these scenes thinking they were amazing, and trying to understand the level of narcissism required. Just delusional film makers that like the smell of each others farts. During the credits I imagined the director is still down there and that's what got it 0.5 rather than 0.","created_at":"2024-02-01T08:02:33.721Z","id":"65bb5019cffeed017cad9783","updated_at":"2024-02-09T23:03:12.390Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/65bb5019cffeed017cad9783"},{"author":"Chandler Danier","author_details":{"name":"Chandler Danier","username":"chandlerdanier","avatar_path":null,"rating":3.0},"content":"This movie is less realistic than Slotherhouse. No one on the crew had their Open Water certification. Absolute crap. 3 because they killed that one really annoying guy who sucked and I imagine he's the wretched people who wrote/directed this crap. But it's only 1.5 hours so...I kinda like it. Would have been 20 minutes had they just opened the door so...I really hate it.","created_at":"2024-02-20T17:31:06.306Z","id":"65d4e1da0f36550186e98ebf","updated_at":"2024-02-20T17:32:21.739Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/65d4e1da0f36550186e98ebf"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":2}
